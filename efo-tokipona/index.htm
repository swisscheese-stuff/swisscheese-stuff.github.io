        <p>WE, the Evil Fountain Openers, are the driving force of progress within these fountain-themed communities. The sealers are just barely attempting to catch up.</p>
        <h2>Openers are Inclusive!</h2>
        <p>If you look on the Good Fountain Sealer subreddit, you may notice a rule that says "No discrimination", that attempts to make the sealers look inclusive. 
        However, just above that rule, you will see a rule that says "NO EVIL FOUNTAIN OPENERS" in ALL CAPS. That seems like discrimination to us!</p>
        <p>When we brought this up to the sealers, they brought up rule 2 on our sub, which says "Cannot praise the fraud gang". They seem to belive that this rule
        is discriminating against the fraud gang (or "Fun Gang" as they like to call it). But as discussed before, the sealers themselves are the discriminators, and
        so calling that rule "discrimination" is as nonsensical as telling a transgender person that they are discriminating because they dont't want anyone to say 
        something nice about a transphobic person.</p>
        <p>Oh yeah, also, the sealers want to seal fountains, the things which give objects forms and lives. They don't think a certain group of people have the right
        to live. So much for "No discrimination".</p>
        <h2>Openers Support Free Speech!</h2>
        <p>We wish for everyone to be able to speak freely!</p>
        <p>A sealer might think that the above statement is a lie, because of rules 2 and 4 on our sub, or maybe even rule 3. Well...</p>
        <p>We have already covered rule 2 in the above paragraph.</p>
        <p>Rule 4 is against <i>hating</i> on the Roaring Knight. We accept fair criticims of it.</p>
        <p>And rule 3 is to stop literal propaganda!</p>
        <h2>Join Us!</h2>
        <p>Why should you join us? Well, apart from everything we said above, we have:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Niko from OneShot</li>
            <li>Cookies</li>
            <li>A welcoming community which you can grow and affect</li>

        <p>However, our enemies, the Good Fountain Sealers, have:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Racists (Ralsei literally says that darkners don't matter, another point against their "No discrimination" policy)</li>
            <li>Liars (Susie literally opened a fountain and yet she pretends to be a sealer)</li>
            <li>Freaks (Noelle.)</li>
            <li>Being good (those nerds)</li>
