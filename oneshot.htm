        <h1>Niko's Tricks</h1>
        <p>OneShot is one of the best puzzle games in existence, in my opinion. I had a blast playing it, and I love it. However, because I'm horrible at puzzle games, I had to look up the solutions a few times. Unfortunately, the current OneShot guides mostly just vomit spoilers at you, which isn't very fun. So I've decided to make my own guide, as spoiler free as possible!</p>
        <h2>How to Use this Guide</h2>
        <p>This guide is modelled after <a href="https://www.keyofw.com/baba-is-hint">Keofw's Baba is Hint</a>, a guide to another puzzle game, Baba is You (I would really recommend using Baba is Hint if you are playing Baba is You and struggling with the puzzles, the guide is amazing). Here's how you use this guide (and how you use Baba is Hint, I guess):</p>
        <p>For each puzzle, I’ll provide a series of hints. First there will be a soft nudge, but each successive hint will get more specific and spoilery. So don’t read all the hints at once. Read one, try to solve, then read more. Highlight text to see spoilers, like so<small>*</small>:</p>
        <small>*And yes, I shamelessly stole this text from the Baba is Hint website.</small>
        <p>Small nudge: <font color="FFFFFF">some small hint</font></p>
        <p>Bigger nudge: <font color="FFFFFF">big hint</font></p>
        <p>Specific hint: <font color="FFFFFF">wow so spoilery</font></p>
        <p>Each "section" of the game will be separated by a page. Every section will be listed below.</p>
        <p>Also, OneShot and Baba is You are honestly just very different games, so there will of course be other differences.</p>
