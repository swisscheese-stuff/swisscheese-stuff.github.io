        <h1>Other Fountain Communities</h1>
        <p>As well as the Good Fountain Sealers, there are plenty of other fountain-based communities. Here is a description of some of them.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>r/GoodFountainOpeners: These people open fountains for <i>justified</i> reasons. We like them, they're still opening fountains, the reason doesn't matter.</li>
          <li>r/EvilFountainSealers: These people seal fountains for <i>evil</i> reasons. No consensus has been reached on them.</li>
          <li>r/NeutralFountainWatchers: These guys look at fountains. Not much to say about them, we're neutral towards them.</li>
          <li>r/NeutralFountainPeople: These are the people who maintain the balance of fountains. They haven't really been discussed in our community.</li>
          <li>r/WeirdSnowgraveCasters: The people who want everyone to "<b>PROCEED</b>". There used to be some contemplation of an alliance with them, but the consensus now is clear: They are <i>too</i> evil and we should not interact with them.</li>
        </ul>
